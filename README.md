# AFM-ProteinMPNN

We describe a computational approach to perform AlphaFold-Multimer (AFM) and AlphaFold3 (AF3) predictions for protein-protein complexes using paired MSAs generated with ProteinMPNN interface design calculations. This enables improved prediction of synthetic protein-protein interactions based on computational models from which synthetic MSAs are derived. This computational approach, its rationale and benchmarks across multiple datasets of nanobodies and monobodies are presented in the article: "Designed MSAs guide AlphaFold for improved modeling of loop-mediated protein-protein interactions" by Lourdes Carcelén, Alexandre Casadesús and Enrique Marcos.
